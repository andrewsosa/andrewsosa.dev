### Why rewrite my website _again_?

Because I coded myself into a corner with the themeing. I wanted to use tachyons to modularly add styles to React components while _also_ using Styled Component themes.

But when I wanted to style the classless HTML generated from Markdown content, I had no clear way to do that. I couldn't add my modular tachyons, and I couldn't get the Styled Component color theme provider to override properly for the generated content. _And,_, even if I could, I still had no formatting styles on things like `blockquote`, `pre`, or other HTML elements.

So ultimately, I realized I needed something I'd grown very opposed to since adopting tachyons: an opinionated, cascading style baseline.

As of writing this, I imagine I'll be able to add tachyons on top of the baseline I choose, but I will still need to decide if the light-mode/dark-mode toggle is worth the complexity.

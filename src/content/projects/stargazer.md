# Stargazer
> Find your friends on github


### How It Works

Stargazer recommends the following people to you:

* Your followers that you don't follow.
* People who follow people you follow.
* People who follow your followers.
* People followed by people you follow.
* People your followers follow.

Stargazer ranks recommendations by the number of times a person appears in any of those groups.

A weird side-effect of this graphing is you might be recommended someone who's followed by a follower, but you don't know that follower, and you definetely don't know the recommendation.
